You're encountering this issue because **GitHub no longer supports password authentication over HTTPS** ‚Äî and although you've added your **SSH key** to your GitHub account, your Git client is still trying to push using **HTTPS**, not SSH.

---

## üîç Why this happens

When you clone or set up your Git remote like this:

```bash
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/your-repo.git
```

Then Git uses **HTTPS**, and it **asks for username and password (or token)**. Since GitHub **doesn‚Äôt accept passwords anymore**, the result is:

```
remote: Invalid username or token. Password authentication is not supported for Git operations.
```

Even though your SSH key is correctly added, Git isn't using it ‚Äî because you're pushing over HTTPS.

## ‚úÖ How to fix it: Switch remote to use SSH

1. **Check your current remote:**

   ```bash
   git remote -v
   ```

   You'll likely see something like:

   ```
   origin  https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/your-repo.git (fetch)
   origin  https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/your-repo.git (push)
   ```

2. **Change the remote URL to SSH:**

   ```bash
   git remote set-url origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/your-repo.git
   ```

3. **Verify it's now SSH:**

   ```bash
   git remote -v
   ```

   Output should now be:

   ```
   origin  git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/your-repo.git (fetch)
   origin  git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/your-repo.git (push)
   ```

4. **Now try pushing again:**

   ```bash
   git push
   ```

   If your SSH key is properly added and the SSH agent is running, this should now work without asking for a password.

## ‚úÖ Optional: If you're unsure if the SSH key is being used

Run:

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```

You should see something like:

```
Hi YOUR_USERNAME! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
```

If that fails, we can troubleshoot the SSH setup.
