Great question! Here's what happens:

You're currently on a **feature branch** (e.g., `feature/my-work`) that was created from the **development branch** (e.g., `develop`).

### Scenario:

* Teammates merge their feature branches into `develop`.
* You stay on your `feature/my-work` branch and run:

```bash
git pull
```

### ✅ Does that update your feature branch with their merged changes into `develop`?

**No**, it **does not automatically reflect** the changes from `develop` into your current `feature/my-work` branch unless you explicitly bring them in.

### Why?

`git pull` while on `feature/my-work` updates only the **remote tracking branch** for `feature/my-work` (e.g., fetches updates from `origin/feature/my-work`) and merges them into your **local** `feature/my-work`.

It does **not** automatically pull updates from `develop`.

### ✅ How to bring in the latest `develop` changes into your feature branch

You have to explicitly do one of the following **while on your feature branch**:

#### Option 1: Merge `develop` into your feature branch

```bash
git fetch origin
git merge origin/develop
```

#### Option 2: Rebase your feature branch onto latest `develop`

```bash
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/develop
```

> Rebase gives a cleaner linear history, but can be risky if you’ve already pushed your branch and are working with others on it.

### Summary

| Action                      | Brings in changes from `develop`? |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `git pull` (on feature)     | ❌ No                              |
| `git merge origin/develop`  | ✅ Yes                             |
| `git rebase origin/develop` | ✅ Yes                             |
