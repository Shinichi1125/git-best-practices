If I go with the Option 1: Merge develop into your feature branch, before running these: 
git fetch origin
git merge origin/develop
, should I make sure the followings?

- I'm still on my feature branch (e.g., feature/my-work)
- git status returns a clean state (if there are changes not staged for commit, run git stash)
