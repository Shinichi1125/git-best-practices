Yes — based on your assumptions, it is **safe to delete both `feature/work-1234` and `feature/work-1235`**. Here's the breakdown:

---

### ✅ `feature/work-1234`

* ✅ Already **merged** into `development`.
* ✅ The branch is no longer needed.
* ✅ Safe to delete from **Bitbucket** and **locally**, because its changes live on in `development`.

**Action:**

* Delete via Bitbucket UI (as you mentioned).
* (Optional) Delete locally if you have it checked out:

  ```bash
  git branch -d feature/work-1234  # use -d for merged branches
  ```

---

### ✅ `feature/work-1235`

* ❌ **Not merged**, but:
* ✅ Confirmed that **none of its changes are needed** anymore.
* ✅ You **don’t need to preserve its history**.

**Action:**

* Delete via Bitbucket UI.
* (Optional) Delete locally:

  ```bash
  git branch -D feature/work-1235  # use -D for unmerged branches
  ```

> 💡 Use `-D` (capital D) to force-delete an unmerged local branch. Git will warn you otherwise.

### 🛡️ Optional Safety Net

If you're extra cautious about `feature/work-1235`, you can tag or archive it before deletion:

```

Or just keep a backup branch:

```bash
git branch backup/feature-work-1235 feature/work-1235
git push origin backup/feature-work-1235
```
