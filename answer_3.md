Yes — you're absolutely right to be cautious. Before merging `origin/develop` into your feature branch, you should ensure a clean working state to avoid complications. Here's exactly what to check:

---

### ✅ **Checklist before merging `origin/develop` into your feature branch**

1. **You are on your feature branch**

```bash
git branch
```

You should see `* feature/my-work` highlighted.

2. **Your working directory is clean**

```bash
git status
```

Make sure it shows:

```
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

3. **If there are local changes not staged or committed**

* Use `git stash` to temporarily save them:

```bash
git stash push -m "Save work before merging develop"
```

You can later restore them with:

```bash
git stash pop
```

4. **Pull in the latest changes from the remote**

```bash
git fetch origin
```

5. **Merge `origin/develop` into your current feature branch**

```bash
git merge origin/develop
```

---

### ✅ Why this matters:

* Being on your feature branch ensures you're merging `develop` **into** it, not the other way around.
* A clean working directory prevents merge conflicts or interruptions.
* `git fetch` makes sure you're using the **latest** remote changes from `develop`.

Let me know if you'd like to include a backup strategy (e.g., creating a temporary branch before merging for safety).
