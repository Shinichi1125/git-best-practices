Yes — in your scenario, **starting over from the updated `development` branch** is not only reasonable, it’s often the **cleanest and wisest approach**. Let's break this down.

---

## 🔎 Your current situation

* You're on `feature/task-B`, based on `development`.
* You’ve made some commits and pushed them.
* `feature/task-C` (overlapping work) is about to be merged into `development`.
* Once that happens, your work in `feature/task-B` becomes mostly **obsolete** or **redundant**.
* You want to **avoid merge conflicts** and unnecessary cleanup.

---

## ✅ Recommended Action Plan

1. **Wait until `feature/task-C` is merged** into `development`.

2. **Switch to `development` and update it**:

   ```bash
   git checkout development
   git pull origin development
   ```

3. **Start a new branch (e.g., `feature/task-B-v2`)** from the updated `development`:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/task-B-v2
   ```

4. **Reapply or reimplement any non-overlapping parts** of your original work, if necessary.

## 🧼 Why this is the clean approach

* You **avoid conflicts** by not trying to merge outdated or redundant work.
* You **don’t pollute history** with unnecessary changes.
* You **gain clarity**, especially for reviewers, by aligning with the most recent shared codebase.

## 🗂️ What about your old work?

You may want to keep a reference to the old branch, just in case.

* You can **keep it around locally and remotely**:

  ```bash
  git checkout feature/task-B
  git branch -m feature/task-B-old
  git push origin feature/task-B-old
  ```

* Or, just make a local backup:

  ```bash
  git branch feature/task-B-backup
  ```

## 🧠 Summary

| Option                                | Recommended? | Why                                     |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| Merge `feature/task-B` anyway         | ❌            | May cause conflicts & confusion         |
| Start over from updated `development` | ✅            | Clean, conflict-free, relevant          |
| Keep backup of original work          | ✅            | Safety net in case you missed something |

Let me know if you want help extracting just the non-overlapping commits from `feature/task-B` in case some of it is still useful.
