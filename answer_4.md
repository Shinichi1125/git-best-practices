Excellent observation ‚Äî and you're absolutely right to double-check!

### ‚úÖ If your development branch is named `development`, then:

You should run:

```bash
git merge origin/development
```

### üîç Why you might see `develop` elsewhere

* `develop` is just a **common convention** for the main integration branch in Git workflows (like Git Flow).
* Some teams name the long-lived branch `develop`, others use `development`, `dev`, or something else entirely.
* `origin/develop` refers to the remote branch named `develop`. If your branch is `development`, Git will not magically substitute the name ‚Äî you need to use the exact name.

### üîß How to verify the branch name:

You can run:

```bash
git branch -r
```

to list all remote branches, and you'll see something like:

```
origin/main
origin/development
origin/feature/my-work
```

So in your case:

```bash
git fetch origin
git merge origin/development
```

is the correct command.

Let me know if you want to automate branch name detection or compare branches before merging.
